# Exploring Household Energy Usage
My objective was to identify usage patterns in a household's energy usage data in order to forecast future energy consumption.
## Dataset 
This project uses the [Individual household electric power consumption dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.</br>

Variables:
*   Global active power: Total active power consumed (kilowatts, kW)
*   Global reactive power: Total reactive power consumed (kW)
*   Voltage: Average voltage (volts, V)
*   Global intensity: Average current intensity (amperes, A)
*   Sub metering 1: Active energy consumed by the kitchen (Watt hours, Wh)
*   Sub metering 2: Active energy consumed by the laundry (Wh)
*   Sub metering 3: Active energy consumed by the water heater and air conditioning/heater (Wh)
